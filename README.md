# betterbandit
After god knows how long of gaslighting myself into what I thought Bandit looked like in-game, I finally snapped back to reality and locked in.

This mod adds a **new and improved remodel of Bandit** as a skin to the game, along with **two additional variants** that I made!

# Future Plans
Fix coat jittering (The jitter isn't too bad but I'd like to iron it out at some point)

# Credits
Thank you KingEnderBrine for the skin builder, would've been a hell of a lot worse if you didn't make that package.

Shoutout to DragonRoilz for helping me along the whole process of making this. ur the best :DD
